# week-4-game

This is one of my homework assignments from the fourth week of the coding bootcampe course I attended, which you can probably tell from the title.

## Prerequisites and installation

I used no extensions in the building of this game. The most I did was copy the jQuery cdn and paste it into my html page. To obtain the cdn, either Google jQuery cdn or follow this link: [cdn link] (https://code.jquery.com/)
